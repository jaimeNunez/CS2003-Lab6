I think that the fist and most important realization I’ve made from this lab is how useful building your program’s class structure using UML is. Just by drawing the different classes with the instance data and methods for that class really helps me visualize all of the different things I will need to build my program. I feel as if I have a direction that I can begin to program in for really large projects that contain various modules. 
Umple in particular is incredibly useful because it has a great online graphic editor that allows me to make changes to the UML class structure with ease. When I generated the java code using the umple eclipse plug-in it generated a lot more code than I was expecting. As opposed to the instance variables and get/set methods I created in my package, umple created all of my constructors for my different classes with various new methods. It generated methods that I hadn’t even specified but I know will be useful later on. For example, each class now has a toString( ) method I can use to print the contents of the instance data from that class. However, it is important to note that while my umple classes and program will run, it won’t really do anything because none of the functionality has been added. This is something that the individual program will have to do themselves.
